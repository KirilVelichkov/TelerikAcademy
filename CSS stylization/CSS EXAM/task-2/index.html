                        <strong>Dark Knight</strong>. <strong>Caped Crusader</strong>. <strong>World’s Greatest Detective</strong>. Whatever you know him as, wherever you know him from—the blockbuster
                        movies, TV shows, video games, cartoons, or millions of comics—Batman is proof you don’t need superpowers
                        to be a superhero… and the poster boy for what a bad childhood can do to you.

                        Millionaire <strong>Bruce Wayne</strong> was just a kid when he watched his parents get gunned down during a mugging in Gotham City. The crime
                        would define his life, as he dedicated himself to becoming the world’s greatest weapon against crime—the
                        Batman.
                    </p>
                    <p>Forget his Batarangs, Batmobile, or Utility Belt filled with high-tech weapons. Batman is the most feared
                        superhero of all, because he’s pushed himself to the absolute pinnacle of human achievement. He’s
                        a brilliant detective who’s mastered fighting techniques the world’s barely heard of. An Olympic-caliber
                        athlete with a plan for every occasion, Batman’s seemingly always five steps ahead of his foes. But
                        in his crusade against injustice, two questions always loom: How far will he go to protect the innocent,
                        and will he sacrifice his humanity along the way?

                    <p><strong>Batgirl is Barbara Gordon</strong>, a confident young woman as committed to justice as her father, Gotham City’s
                        top cop Commissioner Gordon. But when her overprotective Dad forbids her from joining the force,
                        her admiration of Batman leads her to rebel the way crime-fighting rebels do in Gotham City: by picking
                        up the mantle of the Bat.</p>
                    <p>An exceptional fighter and detective, Batgirl is also unparalleled in her computer skills. With a Utility
                        Belt filled with Batarangs and her own Batcycle to speed her across the city, she pursues justice
                        regardless of whether others—including Batman—wish her to. But Gotham’s criminals are a ruthless
                        and maniacal lot, and every moment she risks her neck means dancing closer to death.</p>

                        If it’s hard being a super hero, what is it like as a sidekick? The heroes get the glory, while you clean up the mess. You
                        don’t make the decisions and you don’t give orders. So, what do you do if you’re the Boy Wonder to
                        one of the most recognizable super heroes in the universe and you’re looking to break out on your
                        own?
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Simple</strong>. <strong>You become Nightwing</strong>.</p>
                    <p>When his circus acrobat family was brutally murdered, Dick Grayson was taken in by billionaire and bat-friendly
                        super hero Bruce Wayne. Bruce shared his secret life as Batman with the young boy and eventually
                        molded him into Robin—the Dark Knight’s partner in Gotham. But as Dick grew older, playing second
                        fiddle to the sternest hero in the Justice League began to wear on him, and eventually he struck
                        out on his own, staying true to what he learned as Robin while coming into his own as a respected
                        member of the super hero pantheon. His code, like his mentor’s, is simple—if you’re breaking the
                        law on his turf, watch out. Anyone who doesn’t can expect a short and most assuredly painful trip
                        to Arkham.</p>
                    <p>Yet, while he may share methods and motivation with Batman, Dick knows what being Batman can do. He doesn’t
                        want to become as dark, controlling and lonely as Bruce. But for all the good he’s accomplished while
                        avoiding it, one question is unavoidable—without going as far as Batman, can Nightwing be as effective
                        as he ultimately wants to be?</p>

                    <p><strong>Every kid wants to be Batman</strong>, but do you have a lifetime of training? A billion-dollar fortune? The dream
                        gets dashed pretty quickly. So OK, maybe you can’t be Batman… but that doesn’t mean you can’t be
                        adopted by him.</p>
                    <p>Acrobat Dick Grayson was the youngest member of his parents’ death-defying circus act. But after their
                        cold-blooded murder, Dick vowed revenge. Seeing a genuine piece of himself in the boy, Batman took
                        him in—and gave him a better outlet for his anger. Becoming Batman’s protégé, Robin is an expert
                        fighter and astounding acrobat—with the toughest example in the world to live up to. But the Boy
                        Wonder’s true strength may lie in not being Batman—and providing a beacon of hope and family throughout
                        the Dark Knight’s grim crusade.</p>
                    <p>Swing through the years with the kid who grew up to become a hero in his own right.But as Dick matures
                        into his own entity—eventually becoming the masked crime fighter Nightwing—Robin proves more than
                        just an identity, but a mantle passed to the most worthy. From the troubled Jason Todd to the overachieving
                        Tim Drake, the mask is now worn by Bruce Wayne’s own son Damian—a rebellious troublemaker who’s been
                        trained by assassins since birth. With a lethal skill set and a marginal sense of mercy, Robin no
                        longer needs Batman to protect him from criminals.</p>
